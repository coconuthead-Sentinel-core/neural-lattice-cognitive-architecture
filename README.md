#### Zone 1: Core Memory (Persistent Layer)
- **Purpose**: Long-term knowledge storage and identity maintenance
- **Persistence**: Cross-session, permanent
- **Contents**: System prompts, user preferences, core rules, foundational context
- **Update Frequency**: Rarely (only for fundamental changes)

#### Zone 2: Working Memory (Active Layer)
- **Purpose**: Current task management and project context
- **Persistence**: Session-based with structured archival
- **Contents**: Active projects, ongoing tasks, recent decisions, relevant history
- **Update Frequency**: Regular (per session or major milestone)

#### Zone 3: Execution Context (Transient Layer)
- **Purpose**: Immediate processing and response generation
- **Persistence**: Ephemeral (single interaction)
- **Contents**: Current query, immediate context, real-time outputs
- **Update Frequency**: Continuous (every interaction)

### Memory Persistence Strategy

The framework implements a sophisticated memory persistence strategy:

1. **Structured Documentation**: All memory zones stored in structured markdown format
2. **Hierarchical Organization**: Clear separation between persistence levels
3. **Context Injection**: Systematic reloading of relevant memory into AI sessions
4. **Incremental Updates**: Efficient updates without full rewrites
5. **Version Control**: Git-based tracking of memory evolution

### Solving Context-Loss

Traditional AI interactions suffer from context-loss when conversations end or exceed token limits. Neural Lattice solves this through:

- **Explicit Memory Externalization**: Critical context stored outside AI sessions
- **Structured Retrieval**: Systematic context reinjection at session start
- **Layered Persistence**: Different retention strategies for different information types
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Seamless conversation threads across time
- **Smart Context Compression**: Efficient summarization of historical interactions
